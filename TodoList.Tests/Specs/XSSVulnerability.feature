Feature: XSSVulnerability
	In order to avoid cross-site scripting
	As a concerned security user
	I want to ensure that there is validation on injection

@security
Scenario: Todo List does not allow HTML 
	Given I have entered HTML code in the text editor
	When I press submit
	Then there should be validation on the string
